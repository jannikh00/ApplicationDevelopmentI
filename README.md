## Instructions
- Navigate to each folder for assignment or project details.
- Each folder has its own `README.md` with specifics, including descriptions, objectives, and required files.

## Contents
1. **02-Midterm**: I built a mini portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and PythonAnywhere to showcase my skills and projects.
2. **03-Assignment-Week5**: I applied SQL skills to build a relational database, perform operations, and manage data efficiently.

Each folder can then be further structured based on whether it’s an assignment or a project with relevant documentation.
