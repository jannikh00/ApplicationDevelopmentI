In this assignment, I created a database using SQL, designed a table for books 
with attributes like title, author, genre, and year published, and populated 
it with various entries. I performed essential SQL operations such as selecting 
data by criteria, updating records, and deleting entries. This exercise helped 
me gain practical experience in database creation, data manipulation, and managing 
SQL queries, strengthening skills necessary for roles like data analysis and 
backend development.
