This project involved creating a personal portfolio website consisting of at least three pages: 
a homepage, an “About Me” page, and a resume page. I planned the structure of the site, 
implemented the HTML and CSS to ensure consistent design, and deployed it using the PythonAnywhere 
platform. The assignment demonstrated my ability to design, build, and deploy websites while 
enhancing user experience through responsive navigation and styling. The project concluded with 
documenting challenges and insights.
