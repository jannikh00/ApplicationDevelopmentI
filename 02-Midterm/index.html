            <div class="intro">
                <p>Hello! My name is Jannik Hofmann, and I am passionate about Soccer and Computer Science. I have a
                    background in
                    Computer Science, and Business and have worked on various exciting
                    projects that have helped me grow both professionally and personally.</p>
                <p>My career goals include to become a versatile technology expert, specializing in developing secure
                    and intelligent
                    software solutions. I aim to integrate artificial intelligence into applications while ensuring
                    robust
                    cybersecurity practices. By combining my skills in software development, AI engineering, and
                    cybersecurity,
                    I strive to create cutting-edge technologies that are both innovative and secure, addressing the
                    challenges of
                    tomorrow’s digital landscape. I’m currently seeking internship opportunities to gain hands-on
                    experience in my
                    field and apply my skills in real-world projects. I am
                    eager to work in an environment where I can continue to develop
                    my skills and make meaningful contributions.</p>
